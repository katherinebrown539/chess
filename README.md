This is a fully-functioning Chess game.

The project is far from complete, but in its current state, it is fully playable. 

To run, please ensure that you have the most recent Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. Also, please install Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi).

In your command line, run the build.bat script. This will compile all the source files and run the game.
