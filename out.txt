To check for checkmate!
If king's loc is under attack,
	for each possible move the king can do:
		if that move is under attack, 
			remove move from list
	if there are no possible moves left
		game is over
	else
		the only possible moves for the king are what's lefts

Square Center now needs a boolean is_attacked, and if a piece can move to this square, is_attacked needs to 
true.
